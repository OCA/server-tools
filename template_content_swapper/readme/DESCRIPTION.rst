This module offers a generic functionality for replacing QWeb view elements.
Typically, element replacements are conducted through a template using an XPATH replacement by creating a new module.
With this module, users don't need to do this; they simply need to create template.content.mapping records for the templates they wish to modify.

Examples:

* Replace 'Salesperson' label with 'Sales Representative' in the quotation print.
* Replace 'Add to Cart' button with 'Add to Basket' in the eCommerce product page.
