This module provides an interface/adapter mechanism for the definition
of remote systems.

Note that this module stores everything in plain text. In the interest
of security, it is recommended you use another module (such as keychain
or red_october to encrypt things like the password and private key).
This is not done here in order to not force a specific security method.

Usage
=====

Implementation
--------------

The credentials for systems are stored in the ``external.system`` model,
and are to be configured by the user. This model is the unified
interface for the underlying adapters.

Using the Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given an ``external.system`` singleton called ``external_system``, you
would do the following to get the underlying system client:

.. code:: python

   with external_system.client() as client:
       client.do_something()

The client will be destroyed once the context has completed. Destruction
takes place in the adapter's ``external_destroy_client`` method.

The only unified aspect of this interface is the client connection
itself. Other more opinionated interface/adapter mechanisms can be
implemented in other modules, such as the file system interface in
`OCA/server-tools/external_file_location <https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/tree/9.0/external_file_location>`__.

Creating an Adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modules looking to add an external system adapter should inherit the
``external.system.adapter`` model and override the following methods:

-  ``external_get_client``: Returns a usable client for the system
-  ``external_destroy_client``: Destroy the connection, if applicable.
   Does not need to be defined if the connection destroys itself.
