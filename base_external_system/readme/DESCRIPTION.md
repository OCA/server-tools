This module provides an interface/adapter mechanism for the definition
of remote systems.

Note that this module stores everything in plain text. In the interest
of security, it is recommended you use another module (such as keychain
or red_october to encrypt things like the password and private key).
This is not done here in order to not force a specific security method.
