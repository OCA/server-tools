Track user operation on data models
===================================

This module allows the administrator to log user operations performed on data
models such as ``create``, ``read``, ``write`` and ``delete``.

Usage
=====

Go to `Reporting / Audit / Rules` to subscribe rules. A rule defines which
operations to log for a given data model.
Then, check logs in the `Reporting / Audit / Logs` menu.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * log ``read`` operations
 * log only operations triggered by some users (currently it logs all users)
 * group logs by HTTP query (thanks to werzeug)?
 * group HTTP query by user session?
