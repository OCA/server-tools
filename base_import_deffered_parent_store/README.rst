=================================
Base Import Deffered Parent Store
=================================

Add an options in the base import to allow deffered parent store computation.

Usage
=====

When importing a file using the import view, a new checkbox called
"Deffered parent store computation" is available. If the current model
has the parent_store option, the parent store computation will be called at
the end of the import. It improves the performance when having a large amount of data.
