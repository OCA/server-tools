This module provides base classes and models to manage time windows through
`time.window.mixin`.

Usage
=====

Example implementation for the mixin can be found in module `test_base_time_window`.

As a time window will always be linked to a related model thourgh a M2o relation,
when defining the new model inheriting the mixin, one should pay attention to the
following points in order to have the overlapping check work properly:

- Define class property `_overlap_check_field`: This must state the M2o field to
  use for the to check of overlapping time window records linked to a specific
  record of the related model.

- Add the M2o field to the related model in the `api.constrains`:


For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PartnerTimeWindow(models.Model):
        _name = 'partner.time.window'
        _inherit = 'time.window.mixin'

        partner_id = fields.Many2one(
            res.partner', required=True, index=True, ondelete='cascade'
        )

        _overlap_check_field = 'partner_id'

        @api.constrains('partner_id')
        def check_window_no_overlaps(self):
            return super().check_window_no_overlaps()

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Storing times using `float_time` widget requires extra processing to ensure
  computations are done in the right timezone, because the value is not stored
  as UTC in the database, and must therefore be related to a `tz` field.

  `float_time` in this sense should only be used for durations and not for a
  "point in time" as this is always needs a Date for a timezone conversion to
  be done properly. (Because a conversion from UTC to e.g. Europe/Brussels won't
  give the same result in winter or summer because of Daylight Saving Time).

  Therefore the right move would be to use a `resource.calendar` to define time
  windows using Datetime with recurrences.
