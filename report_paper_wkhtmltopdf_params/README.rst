===============================
Report Paper Wkhtmltopdf Params
===============================

This module allows you to add new parameters for a paper format which are
then forwarded to wkhtmltopdf command as arguments. To display the arguments
that wkhtmltopdf accepts go to your command line and type 'wkhtmltopdf -H'.

A commonly used parameter in Odoo is *--disable-smart-shrinking*, that will
disable the automatic resizing of the PDF when converting. This is
important when you intend to have a layout that conforms to certain alignment.
It is very common whenever you need to conform the PDF to a predefined
layoyut (e.g. checks, official forms,...).


Usage
=====

# Go to *Settings* and press 'Activate the developer mode (with assets)'

# Go to *Settings - Technical - Reports - Paper Format*

# Add additional parameters indicating the command argument name (remember to
  add prefix -- or -) and value.
