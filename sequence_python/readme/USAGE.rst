To use this module, you need to:

* Go to the form view of an `ir.sequence` record
* Go to the Python tab
* Enable the 'Use Python' checkbox
* Change the default 'number' expression to something more fancy.

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

   # To separate the Odoo-generated number with hyphens eg. 0-0-0-0-1
   '-'.join(number_padded)

   # To have an UUID as the sequence value
   uuid.uuid4().hex

   # To use an 8-digit binary number
   '{0:#010b}'.format(number + 300)[2:]

And so on.
