This module allows to generate a sequence by a Python formula expression.

Besides common Python functions and operators, it provides several functions
like 'random' and 'uuid' in the expression, as well as variables such as the
next number in the sequence. These are also listed next to the input field
on the sequence form view.

If you want to add more variables for use in the expression, you can extend
this module.

Use cases for this module could be:

- You want to generate alphanumeric numbering
- You want to apply some math to the number to prevent customers from knowing
  their place in the sequence
- You want to use UUID
