==================
Module Auto Update
==================

This module will automatically check for and apply module upgrades on a schedule.

Upgrade checking is accomplished by comparing the SHA1 checksums of currently-installed modules to the checksums of corresponding modules in the addons directories.

Installation
============

Prior to installing this module, you need to:

#. Install checksumdir with `pip install checksumdir`
#. Ensure all installed modules are up-to-date. When installed, this module will assume the versions found in the addons directories are currently installed.

Configuration
=============

The default time for checking and applying upgrades is 3:00 AM (UTC). To change this schedule, modify the "Perform Module Upgrades" scheduled action.

This module will ignore .pyc and .pyo file extensions by default. To modify this, create a module_auto_update.checksum_excluded_extensions system parameter with the desired extensions listed as comma-separated values.

Usage
=====

Modules scheduled for upgrade can be viewed by clicking the "Updates" menu item in the Apps sidebar.

To perform upgrades manually, click the "Apply Scheduled Upgrades" menu item in the Apps sidebar.
