#. Go to *Settings > Techinical > Database Structure > Models*.
#. Open a model for which attachment deletion should be restricted.
#. Select 'Restrict Attachment Deletion', and assign 'Attachment Deletion Groups' and/or
   'Attachment Deletion Users' as necessary (if no assignment, no one can delete the
   attachments of this model).

For assigning 'Attachment Deletion Groups'/'Attachment Deletion Users' to the model,
you can alternatively add the model in the 'Attachment Deletion Models' tab in the
respective group/user form.
