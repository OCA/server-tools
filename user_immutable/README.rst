==============
User Immutable
==============

This module adds a group named `Immutable` which cannot be altered by users 
outside of that group. By default, the `Administrator` user is the only user
given access to this group on install. This module also adds protections 
against non-members granting/revoking membership to this group.



Installation
============

* Install module as normal

Usage
=====

Simply add any user to the `Immutable` group, provided that your login user 
is a member of that group already.
