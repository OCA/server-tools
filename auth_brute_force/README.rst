===============================================================
Tracks Authentication Attempts and Prevents Brute-force Attacks
===============================================================

This module registers each request done by users trying to authenticate into
Odoo. If the authentication fails, a counter is increased for the given remote
IP. After a defined number of attempts, Odoo will ban the remote IP and
ignore new requests.
This module applies security through obscurity
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity),
When a user is banned, the request is now considered as an attack. So, the UI
will **not** indicate to the user that his IP is banned and the regular message
'Wrong login/password' is displayed.

This module realizes a call to a web API (http://ip-api.com) to try to have
extra information about remote IP.

Known issue / Roadmap
---------------------
The ID used to identify a remote request is the IP provided in the request
(key 'REMOTE_ADDR').
Depending of server and / or user network configuration, the idenfication
of the user can be wrong, and mainly in the following cases:

* if the Odoo server is behind an Apache / NGinx proxy without redirection,
  all the request will be have the value '127.0.0.1' for the REMOTE_ADDR key;
* If some users are behind the same Internet Service Provider, if a user is
  banned, all the other users will be banned too;

Configuration
-------------

Once installed, you can change the ir.config_parameter value for the key
'auth_brute_force.max_attempt_qty' (10 by default) that define the max number
of attempts allowed before the user was banned.

Usage
-----

Admin user have the possibility to unblock a banned IP.

Logging
-------

This module generates some WARNING logs, in the three following cases:

* Authentication failed from remote '127.0.0.1'. Login tried : 'admin'.
  Attempt 1 / 10.

* Authentication failed from remote '127.0.0.1'. The remote has been banned.
  Login tried : 'admin'.

* Authentication tried from remote '127.0.0.1'. The request has been ignored
  because the remote has been banned after 10 attempts without success. Login
  tried : 'admin'.
