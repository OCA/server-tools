Migration Toolkit
=================

A collection of tools to make your module migrations a piece of cake and avoid
most common mistakes.

This is focused to single module migrations. If you need whole Odoo migrations
(i.e. from Odoo 8 to Odoo 9), please consider using OpenUpgrade_ and
openupgradelib_.

.. _OpenUpgrade: https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade
.. _openupgradelib: https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib

Installation
============

This module adds no models, no controllers, no views... it just adds a toolkit
to use in your migrations that can be used without installing, so don't install
it.

Development
===========
