================
Base Custom Info
================

This module allows to create custom fields in models without altering model's
structure.

Installation
============

This module serves as a base for other modules that implement this behavior in
concrete models.

This module is a technical dependency and is to be installed in parallel to
other modules.

Usage
=====

This module defines *Custom Info Templates* that define what properties are
expected for a given record.

To define a template, you need to:

* Go to *Settings > Custom Info > Templates*.
* Create one.
* Add some *Properties* to it.

All database records with that template enabled will automatically fill those
properties.

To manage the properties, you need to:

* Go to *Settings > Custom Info > Properties*.

To manage their values, you need to:

* Go to *Settings > Custom Info > Values*.
