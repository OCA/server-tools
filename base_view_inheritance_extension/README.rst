=========================
Extended view inheritance
=========================

This module was written to make it simple to add custom operators for view
inheritance.

Usage
=====

Change a python dictionary (context for example)
------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: xml

    <attribute name="$attribute" operation="python_dict" key="$key">
        $new_value
    </attribute>

Note that views are subject to evaluation of xmlids anyways, so if you need
to refer to some xmlid, say ``%(xmlid)s``.

Move an element in the view
---------------------------

.. code-block:: xml

    <xpath expr="$xpath" position="move" target="$targetxpath" />

This can also be used to wrap some element into another, create the target
element first, then move the node youwant to wrap there.

Add to values in a list (states for example)
--------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: xml

    <attribute name="$attribute" operation="list_add">
        $new_value(s)
    </attribute>

Remove values from a list (states for example)
----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: xml

    <attribute name="$attribute" operation="list_remove">
        $remove_value(s)
    </attribute>

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* add ``<attribute operation="json_dict" key="$key">$value</attribute>``
* support ``<xpath expr="$xpath" position="move" target="xpath" target_position="position" />``
* support an ``eval`` attribute for our new node types
