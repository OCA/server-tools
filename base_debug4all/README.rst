Debug4all
=========

This module turns on the full debug menu for all users.

Note: This module only *shows* debug options for all users. If a user without the necessary privileges tries to execute an action she's not permitted to execute, it will result in ugly exceptions.

Usage
=====

When in debug mode, enjoy the full debug menu for users different than admin.
