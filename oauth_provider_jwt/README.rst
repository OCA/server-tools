====================
OAuth Provider - JWT
====================

This module adds the JSON Web Token support to OAuth2 provider.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

#. Install the pyjwt and cryptography python modules
#. Install the module like any other in Odoo

Configuration
=============

This module adds a new token type in the OAuth client configuration.

Once the *JSON Web Token* type is selected, a new tab appears at the bottom, where you'll have to select an algorithm for the token signature.

For asymetric algorithms, it is possible to put a custom private key, or the module can generate one for you.
The public key is automatically computed from the private one.

Usage
=====

There is no usage change from the base OAuth2 provider module.

The public key can be retrieved by clients using this URL: http://odoo.example.com/oauth2/public_key?client_id=identifier_of_the_oauth_client
