=====


Dashboards > Sql Export


**Specific use with parameters**

- `%(company_id)s` allows to set in the query the company id of the user
- `%(user_id)s` allows to set in the query the user id
- for any created field with `Sql Export Variables` menu, you can use it with `%(x_field_example)s` syntax 
  (Limitation for relational fields)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Some words are prohibited and can't be used is the query in anyways, even in
  a select query:
  - delete
  - drop
  - insert
  - alter
  - truncate
  - execute
  - create
  - update

See sql_request_abstract module to fix this issue.

* checking SQL request by execution and rollback is disabled in this module
  since variables features has been introduced. This can be fixed by
  overloading _prepare_request_check_execution() function.

* Move modules sql_request_abstract and sql_export to oca/reporting-engine
