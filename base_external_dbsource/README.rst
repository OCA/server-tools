Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Find a way to remove or default the CA certs dir
* Add concept of multiple connection strings for one source (multiple nodes)
* Add a ConnectionEnvironment that allows for the reuse of connections
* Message box should be displayed instead of error in ``connection_test``
* Remove old api compatibility layers (v11)
* Instead of returning list of results, we should return iterators. This will support
  larger datasets in a more efficient manner.
* Implement better CRUD handling
