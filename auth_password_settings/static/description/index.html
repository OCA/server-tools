                This section allows you to determine password complexity (the effectiveness of a password in resisting guessing and brute-force attacks). To do that,</p>
                <p>
                * use the Minimum password length to determine how long the password should be to be considered strong, By default, the password should be at least 6 characters long.</p>
                <p>
                * check the appropriate boxes below the bar to determine the character set that must be used in the password: capital letters, digits, special characters.
