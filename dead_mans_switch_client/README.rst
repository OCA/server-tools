This module is the client part of ``dead_mans_switch_server``. It is responsible
for sending the server status updates, which in turn takes action if those
updates don't come in time.

It also sends CPU and RAM statistics to the server. This is helpful for
assessing a server's health.

Configuration
=============

After installing this module, you need to fill in the system parameter
``dead_mans_switch_client.url``. This must be the full URL to the server's
controller, usually of the form ``https://your.server/dead_mans_switch/alive``.

You can have the number of currently online users logged, but this only
works if the ``bus`` module is installed and longpolling configured correctly.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* certificate pinning would be nice
