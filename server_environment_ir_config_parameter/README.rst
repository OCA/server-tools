Override System Parameters from server environment file.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to add a section ``[ir.config_parameter]`` to
you server_environment_files configurations, where the keys are the same
as would normally be set in the Systems Parameter Odoo menu.

When first using a value, the system will read it from the configuration file
and override any value that would be present in the database, so the configuration
file has precedence.

When creating or modifying values that are in the configuration file, the
module replace changes, enforcing the configuration value.

For example you can use this module in combination with web_environment_ribbon:

.. code::

   [ir.config_parameter]
   ribbon.name=DEV

Usage
=====

Before using this module, you must be familiar with the
server_environment module.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

When the user modifies System Parameters that are defined in the config
file, the changes are ignored. It would be nice to display which system
parameters come from the config file and possibly make their key and value
readonly in the user interface.
