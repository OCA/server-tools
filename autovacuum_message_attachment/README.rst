Odoo create a lot of message and/or mails. With time it can slow the system or take a lot of disk space.
The goal of this module is to clean these message once they are obsolete.
The same may happen with attachment that we store.
You can choose various criterias manage which messages you want to delete automatically.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

* Go to the menu configuration => Technical => Email => Message And Attachment Vacuum Rules
* Add the adequates rules for your company. On each rule, you can indicate the models, type and subtypes for which you want to delete the messages, along with a retention time (in days). Or for attachment, you can specify a substring of the name.
* Activate the cron AutoVacuum Mails and Messages and/or AutoVacuum Attachments

It is recommanded to run it frequently and when the system is not very loaded.
(For instance : once a day, during the night.)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

You have to be careful with rules regarding attachment deletion because Odoo find the attachment to delete with their name.
Odoo will find all attachments containing the substring configured on the rule, so you have to be specific enough on the other criterias (concerned models...) to avoid unwanted attachment deletion.
