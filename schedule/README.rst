This technical module does add an advanced system for scheduling actions.
It allows planning weekly, monthly and yearly with an interval. For weekly schedules, it allows to specifiy the exact days of action.
Notice: This technical module does not directly allow automation. Rather it is destined to aid the development of other modules.

For configuring the schedules, navigate to Settings --> Technical --> Automation --> Schedules in the Odoo backend.
