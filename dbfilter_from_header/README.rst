====================
dbfilter_from_header
====================

This addon lets you pass a dbfilter as a HTTP header.

This is interesting for setups where database names can't be mapped to proxied host names.

Installation
============

To install this module, you only need to add it to your addons, and load it as
a server-wide module.

This can be done with the ``load`` parameter in ``/etc/odoo.conf`` or with the
``--load`` command-line parameter

``load = "web, dbfilter_from_header"``

Configuration
=============

Please keep in mind that the standard odoo dbfilter configuration is still
applied before looking at the regular expression in the header.

* For nginx, use:

  ``proxy_set_header X-Odoo-dbfilter [your filter regex];``

* For caddy, use:

  ``proxy_header X-Odoo-dbfilter [your filter regex]``

* For Apache, use:

  ``RequestHeader set X-Odoo-dbfilter [your filter regex]``


Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.
