dbfilter_from_header
====================

This addon lets you pass a dbfilter as a HTTP header.

This is interesting for setups where database names can't be mapped to proxied host names.

Configuration
=============

In nginx, use one of:

* proxy_set_header X-OpenERP-dbfilter [your filter];
* proxy_set_header X-Odoo-dbfilter [your filter];

This addon has to be loaded as server-wide module.
