Please keep in mind that the standard odoo dbfilter configuration is still
applied before looking at the regular expression in the header.

* For nginx, use:

  ``proxy_set_header X-Odoo-dbfilter [your filter regex];``

* For caddy, use:

  ``proxy_header X-Odoo-dbfilter [your filter regex]``

* For Apache, use:

  ``RequestHeader set X-Odoo-dbfilter [your filter regex]``

And make sure that proxy mode is enabled in Odoo's configuration file:

``proxy_mode = True``
