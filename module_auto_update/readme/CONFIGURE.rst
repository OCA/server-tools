This module supports the following system parameters:

* ``module_auto_update.exclude_patterns``: comma-separated list of file
  name patterns to ignore when computing addon checksums. Defaults to
  ``*.pyc,*.pyo,i18n/*.pot,i18n_extra/*.pot,static/*``.
  Filename patterns must be compatible with the python ``fnmatch`` function.

In addition to the above pattern, .po files corresponding to languages that
are not installed in the Odoo database are ignored when computing checksums.
