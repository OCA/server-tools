This addon provides mechanisms to compute sha1 hashes of installed addons,
and save them in the database. It also provides a method that exploits these
mechanisms to update a database by upgrading only the modules for which the
hash has changed since the last successful upgrade.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

This module supports the following system parameters:

* ``module_auto_update.exclude_patterns``: comma-separated list of file
  name patterns to ignore when computing addon checksums. Defaults to
  ``*.pyc,*.pyo,i18n/*.pot,i18n_extra/*.pot,static/*``.
  Filename patterns must be compatible with the python ``fnmatch`` function.

In addition to the above pattern, .po files corresponding to languages that
are not installed in the Odoo database are ignored when computing checksums.

Usage
=====

The main method provided by this module is ``upgrade_changed_checksum``
on ``ir.module.module``. It runs a database upgrade for all installed
modules for which the hash has changed since the last successful
run of this method. On success it saves the hashes in the database.

The first time this method is invoked after installing the module, it
runs an upgrade of all modules, because it has not saved the hashes yet.
This is by design, priviledging safety. Should this be an issue,
the method ``_save_installed_checksums`` can be invoked in a situation
where one is sure all modules on disk are installed and up-to-date in the
database.

To invoke the upgrade mechanism, navigate to *Apps* menu and use the
*Auto-Upgrade Modules* button, available only in developer mode. Restarting
the Odoo instance is highly recommended to minify risk of any possible issues.

Another easy way to invoke this upgrade mechanism is by issuing the following
in an Odoo shell session:

.. code-block:: python

  env['ir.module.module'].upgrade_changed_checksum()
