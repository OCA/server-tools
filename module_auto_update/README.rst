==================
Module Auto Update
==================

This addon provides mechanisms to compute sha1 hashes of installed addons,
and save them in the database. It also provides a method that exploits these
mechanisms to update a database by upgrading only the modules for which the
hash has changed since the last successful upgrade.

Configuration
=============

This module supports the following system parameters:

* ``module_auto_update.exclude_patterns``: comma-separated list of file
  name patterns to ignore when computing addon checksums. Defaults to
  ``*.pyc,*.pyo,i18n/*.pot,i18n_extra/*.pot,static/*``.
  Filename patterns must be compatible with the python ``fnmatch`` function.

In addition to the above pattern, .po files corresponding to languages that
are not installed in the Odoo database are ignored when computing checksums.

Usage
=====

The main method provided by this module is ``upgrade_changed_checksum``
on ``ir.module.module``. It runs a database upgrade for all installed
modules for which the hash has changed since the last successful
run of this method. On success it saves the hashes in the database.

The first time this method is invoked after installing the module, it
runs an upgrade of all modules, because it has not saved the hashes yet.
This is by design, priviledging safety. Should this be an issue,
the method ``_save_installed_checksums`` can be invoked in a situation
where one is sure all modules on disk are installed and up-to-date in the
database.

An easy way to invoke this upgrade mechanism is by issuing the following
in an Odoo shell session::

  env['ir.module.module'].upgrade_changed_checksum()

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Since version ``2.0.0``, some features have been deprecated.
  When you upgrade from previous versions, these features will be kept for
  backwards compatibility, but beware! They are buggy!

  If you install this addon from scratch, these features are disabled by
  default.

  To force enabling or disabling the deprecated features, set a configuration
  parameter called ``module_auto_update.enable_deprecated`` to either ``1``
  or ``0``. It is recommended that you disable them.

  Keep in mind that from this version, all upgrades are assumed to run in a
  separate odoo instance, dedicated exclusively to upgrade Odoo.

* When migrating the addon to new versions, the deprecated features should be
  removed. To make it simple all deprecated features are found in files
  suffixed with ``_deprecated``.
