This module allows to:
----------------------

* mark e-mails older than x days as read,
* move those messages in a specific folder,
* remove messages older than x days
  on IMAP servers, just before fetching them.

Since the main "mail" module does not mark unroutable e-mails as read,
this means that if junk mail arrives in the catch-all address without
any default route, fetching newer e-mails will happen after re-parsing
those unroutable e-mails.

Configuration
=============

This module depends on ``mail_environment`` in order to add "expiration dates"
per server.

Example of a configuration file (add those values to your server)::

  [incoming_mail.openerp_imap_mail1]
  cleanup_days = False  # default value
  purge_days = False  # default value
  cleanup_folder = NotParsed  # optional parameter
