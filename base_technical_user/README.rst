This module extends the functionality of company management.
It allows you to bind a technical user on the company in order to use it in
batch processes.

The technical user must
- be inactive to avoid login
- be in the required groups depending of what you need to do

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

If you install the module, you will find a tab on the company form allowing
to define the technical user.

In your code you can use the following helper that will return you

- a self with the user tech if configured
- or a self with sudo user

.. code-block:: python

    self_tech = self.sudo_tech()

If you want to raise an error if the tech user in not configured just call it with

.. code-block:: python

    self_tech = self.sudo_tech(raise_if_missing)
