OAuth multi token
=================

This module adds the possibility to connect with the same account
on more than one device at the same time.

All providers are supported (Google, Facebook, Odoo, etc).

Configuration and usage
=======================

On users' form you can set the number of maximum simultaneous connections.

By default 10 connections are allowed.
