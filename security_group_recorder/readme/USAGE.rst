To use this module, you need to:

#. To start recording: click on the 'play' button, located on the top right of the window.
#. Perform the workflow you want the users added to your group to be able to perform. As more detailed are the operations performed, the user group proposed will be more precise.
#. Once you are done recording, click again on the 'play' button. A user group proposal will pop up.
#. Give a name to your security group, and if needed, make the necessary updates.
#. Once you are satisfied with your group configuration, **save the changes** and click on 'create security group' button to create that group.
#. If you are not satisfied, discard or close the pop up, and when needed start recording again.
