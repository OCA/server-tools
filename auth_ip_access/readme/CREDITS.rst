* Some technical guidance was aquired from the module 'auth_brute_force' in
  this repository. A big thanks to the author of that module, Sylvan Le Gal
  and its subsequent contributors, especially Jairo Llopis for his work on
  making the remote address available at all times.
* The heavy lifting of this module is done by https://pypi.org/project/py2-ipaddress/.
