* **No database separation** -- This module functions by intercepting all Odoo
  logging records in a running Odoo process. This means that once installed in
  one database, it will intercept and report errors for all Odoo databases,
  which are used on that Odoo server.

* **Frontend integration** -- In the future, it would be nice to add
  Odoo client-side error reporting to this module as well, by integrating
  `raven-js <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js>`_. Additionally, `Sentry user
  feedback form <https://docs.sentry.io/learn/user-feedback/>`_ could be
  integrated into the Odoo client error dialog window to allow users shortly
  describe what they were doing when things went wrong.
