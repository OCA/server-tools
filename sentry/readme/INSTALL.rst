The module can be installed just like any other Odoo module, by adding the
module's directory to Odoo *addons_path*. In order for the module to correctly
wrap the Odoo WSGI application, it also needs to be loaded as a server-wide
module. This can be done with the ``server_wide_modules`` parameter in your
Odoo config file or with the ``--load`` command-line parameter.

This module additionally requires the sentry-sdk Python package to be available on
the system. It can be installed using pip::

    pip install sentry-sdk
