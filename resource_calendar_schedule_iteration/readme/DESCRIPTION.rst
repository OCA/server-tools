When you want to plan a number of days in the past or in the future considering
a working calendar, Odoo limits the number of days/hours that you can plan
ahead.

In case that you want to plan days forward/backward, it currently restricts
to 100 iterations.

This module allows you to increase the iteration limit used in the resource
calendar to schedule days or hours by means of a system parameter defined
by the administrator.
