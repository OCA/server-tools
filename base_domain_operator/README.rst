=======================
Custom domain operators
=======================

This module was written to allow developers to define custom domain operators. This can be very helpful for complicated selections or ir.rules.

Currently implemented operators
===============================

``parent_of``
  The inverse of ``child_of``: Searches for the parents of given records in the hierarchy, including the records themselves::

    [('id', 'parent_of', [42])]

``substring_of``
  The inverse of ``like``: Searches for values that are a substring of the value given. Note that this is very inefficient in general::

    [('ref', 'substring_of', 'long string')]

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. depend on it
#. use one of the operators explained above in any of your domains

To add your own operators:

#. in ``base.domain.operator``, define a function ``_operator_${your_operator}`` with decorator ``@api.model`` and signature ``leaf, expression``
#. ``leaf`` is a 3-tuple of a domain proposition, ``expression`` an instance of ``openerp.osv.expression.expression``
#. return a list of ``openerp.osv.expression.ExtendedLeaf`` instances that maps your operator to some expressions the original domain parser can evaluate
#. note that you can use the internal ``inselect`` operator here if you pass ``internal=True`` to ``ExtendedLeaf``'s constructor
#. be careful with using the ORM in those handlers to avoid infinite loops
#. take good care that you don't introduce SQL injections and other security problems

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* given the upstream code is not exactly extension friendly, we'll have to reimplement a bunch of helper functions
* ``parent_of`` currently doesn't support dotted paths and searching for names (``name_get``), this needs to be amended as needed
* another nice operator would be ``indomain``, probably also with a way to refer to the table's columns in the right hand side of expressions
