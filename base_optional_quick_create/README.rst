=====================
Optional quick create
=====================
This module allows to avoid to *quick create* new records, through many2one
fields, for a specific model.
You can configure which models should allow *quick create*.
When specified, the *quick create* option will always open the standard create
form.

Got the idea from https://twitter.com/nbessi/status/337869826028605441

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to *Settings -> Database Structure
-> Models. To prevent quick creation on any model, tick *Avoid quick
create* in the form view of these models.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* If quick creation on the Partner model has been disabled, call the original method if context key 'force_email' is set as this is a special case.
