It also adds a priority field and a kanban view.

* Go to *Settings > Companies > Companies > your company*.


* Go to Tab  *Calendar Event State*

3 basic states are set up by default.

*  To plan
*  Planned
*  Done

Edit  or create new record, like as project task states, you may set:

* Name of  the state
* Sequence
* Folded in Kanban View
