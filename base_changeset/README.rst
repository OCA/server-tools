This module extends the functionality of records. It allows to create
changesets that must be validated when a record is modified instead of direct
modifications. Rules allow to configure which field must be validated.

What is a changeset
-------------------

A changeset is a list of changes made on a record.

Some of the changes may be 'Pending', some 'Accepted' or 'Rejected' according
to the changeset rules.  The 'Pending' changes require an interaction by the
approver user: only when that change is approved, its value is written on
the record.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

Access Rights
-------------

The changesets rules must be edited by users with the group ``Changesets
Configuration``. The changesets can be applied or canceled only by users
with the group ``Changesets Validations``

Changesets Rules
----------------

The changesets rules can be configured in ``Configuration >
Record Changesets > Fields Rules``.

* Configuration of rules

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/server-tools/12.0/base_changeset/base_changeset/static/src/img/rules.png

For each record field, an action can be defined:

* Auto: the changes made on this field are always applied
* Validate: the changes made on this field must be manually confirmed by
  a 'Changesets User' user
* Never: the changes made on this field are always refused

In any case, all the changes made by the users are always applied
directly on the users, but a 'validated' changeset is created for the
history.

The supported fields are:

* Char
* Text
* Date
* Datetime
* Integer
* Float
* Monetary
* Boolean
* Many2one

Rules can be global (no source model) or configured by source model.
Rules by source model have the priority. If a field is not configured
for the source model, it will use the global rule (if existing).

If a field has no rule, it is written to the record without changeset.

Usage
=====

Changeset rules
---------------

The first step is to configure the changeset rules. Once that done, writes on
records will be created as changesets.

Handling changesets
-------------------

The list of all the changesets is in ``Configuration > Record
Changesets > Changesets``.

By default, only the pending changesets (waiting for validation) are shown.
Remove the "Pending" filter to show all the changesets.

* Changeset waiting for validation

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/server-tools/12.0/base_changeset/base_changeset/static/src/img/changeset.png

The changes view shows the name of the record's field, the Origin value
and the New value alongside the state of the change. By clicking on the
change in some cases a more detailed view is displayed, for instance,
links for relations can be clicked on.

A button on a changeset allows to apply or reject all the changes at
once.

Handling single changes
-----------------------

Accessing the changesets gives the full overview of all the changes made.
However, it is more convenient to access the single changes directly from the
records. When there is a pending change for a field you get a badge with the
number of pending changes next to it like this:

* Badge with the number of pending changes

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/server-tools/12.0/base_changeset/base_changeset/static/src/img/badge.png

When you click on it:

* Clicking the badge: red button to reject, green one to apply

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/server-tools/12.0/base_changeset/base_changeset/static/src/img/badge_click.png

Click the red button to reject the change, click the green one to apply it.


Custom source rules in your addon
---------------------------------

Addons wanting to create changeset with their own rules should pass the
following keys in the context when they write on the record:

* ``__changeset_rules_source_model``: name of the model which asks for
  the change
* ``__changeset_rules_source_id``: id of the record which asks for the
  change

Also, they should extend the selection in
``ChangesetFieldRule._domain_source_models`` to add their model (the
same that is passed in ``__changeset_rules_source_model``).

The source is used for the application of the rules, allowing to have a
different rule for a different source. It is also stored on the changeset for
information.

Notes on security
-----------------

Note that by default, changeset users see all changes on all configured
rules. This circumvents read restrictions on the original records, so if you
have restrictions on models with changeset rules, changeset users will still
see all changes of all records, and applying a change on an inaccessible record
will fail.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Only a subset of the type of fields is actually supported
* Multicompany not fully supported
