This module adds a boolean field on models form view, allowing to force
``noupdate=True`` to data linked to those models.

Upon setting the field to ``True`` on a given model, ``noupdate=True`` will be set upon
existing data linked to it. When creating new data linked to that model, they will
always have ``noupdate=True`` (unless the field is reset on the model itself).
