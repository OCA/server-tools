Set this module in the server wide modules.

Set a ``SESSION_DB_URI`` environment variable as a full postgresql connection string,
like ``postgres://user:passwd@server/db`` or ``db``.

It is recommended to use a dedicated database for this module, and possibly a dedicated
postgres user for additional security.
