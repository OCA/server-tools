Store sessions in a database instead of the filesystem. This simplifies the
configuration of horizontally scalable deployments, by avoiding the need for a
distributed filesystem to store the Odoo sessions.

Usage
=====

Set this module in the server wide modules.

Set a ``SESSION_DB_URI`` environment variable as a full postgresql connection string,
like ``postgres://user:passwd@server/db`` or ``db``.

It is recommended to use a dedicated database for this module, and possibly a dedicated
postgres user for additional security.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module does not work with multi-threaded workers, so it requires workers > 0.
