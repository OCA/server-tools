Store sessions in a database instead of the filesystem. This simplifies
the configuration of horizontally scalable deployments, by avoiding the
need for a distributed filesystem to store the Odoo sessions.

Usage
=====

Set this module in the server wide modules.

Set a ``SESSION_DB_URI`` environment variable as a full postgresql
connection string, like ``postgres://user:passwd@server/db`` or ``db``.

It is recommended to use a dedicated database for this module, and
possibly a dedicated postgres user for additional security.
