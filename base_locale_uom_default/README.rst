====================
Locale - Default UoM
====================

This module adds a concept of a default unit of measure on languages, unique by
unit category type.

It also provides a method that can be used in fields to work from said defaults.

Configuration
=============

Set default unit of measures in the `Languages` menu in settings.

Usage
=====

Fields that want to implement the language default should use the provided method,
such as in the below example::

   class MyModel(models.Model):
       _name = 'my.model'
       time_uom_id = fields.Many2one(
           string='Time Units',
           comodel_name='product.uom',
           default=lambda s: s.env['res.lang'].default_uom_by_category('Time'),
       )
