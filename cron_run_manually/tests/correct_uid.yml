- I create a user that will run the job.
- !record {model: res.users, id: worker_user, view: False}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    name: worker
    login: worker
    password: worker
    email: worker@example.com

- Create a cron job to check the UID
- !record {model: ir.cron, id: check_uid_job}:
    name: Check UID
    active: True
    user_id: worker_user
    interval_number: 1
    interval_type: days
    numbercall: -1
    doall: False
    model: ir.cron
    function: _current_uid

- I execute the cron job manually to check its running UID
- !python {model: ir.cron, id: check_uid_job}: |
    assert self.run_manually()[0] == self.user_id.id, "Wrong UID in cron job"
