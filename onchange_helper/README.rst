This is a technical module. Its goal is to ease the play of onchange
method directly called from Python code.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

-  depend on this module
-  call yourmodel.play_onchanges(values, ['field'])

Example if you want to create a sale order and you want to get the
values relative to partner_id field (as if you fill the field from UI)

   vals = {'partner_id': 1}

   vals = self.env['sale.order'].play_onchanges(vals, ['partner_id'])

Then, vals will be updated with partner_invoice_id, partner_shipping_id,
pricelist_id, etc...

Default values will be used to process onchange methods, if respective
fields are not set in vals. You can get them if you pass fields name in
the list of fields.

   vals = {'partner_id': 1}

   vals = self.env['sale.order'].play_onchanges(vals, ['partner_id',
   'date_order'])

vals will contain, in addition to the changed values, the default value
for date_order

You can also use it on existing record for example:

   vals = {'partner_shipping_id': 1}

   vals = sale.play_onchanges(vals, ['partner_shipping_id'])

Then the onchange will be played with the vals passed and the existing
vals of the sale. vals will be updated with partner_invoice_id,
pricelist_id, etc..

Behind the scene, play_onchanges will execute **all the methods**
registered for the list of changed fields, so you do not have to call
manually each onchange. To avoid performance issue when the method is
called on a record, the record will be transformed into a memory record
before calling the registered methods to avoid to trigger SQL updates
command when values are assigned to the record by the onchange

Notes:

-  Order in onchange_fields is very important as onchanges methods will
   be played in that order.
-  If you use memory object in vals, be award that onchange method in
   base model call self.invalidate_cache() that reset it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Note that onchanges tend to disappear due to the introduction of
'computed stored readonly False fields' in most cases. When migrating,
it is best to prefer changing it to that way instead of using this
module.
