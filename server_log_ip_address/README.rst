=====================
server_log_ip_address
=====================

This module was written to extend the security of your Odoo server.

The main purpose of this module is to log the failed logins
(as well as the successfull ones) with the corresponding offending IP Address.

In conjunction with `Fail2ban <http://www.fail2ban.org>`_, you then have an effective
method to protect your Odoo Instance.

Configuration
=============

There is no configuration required for this specific module;
however, you will need to configure Fail2Ban.

In the doc directory of this module, you will find the configuration files to deploy
fail2ban.
