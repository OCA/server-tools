Adds the possibility to attach emails from a certain IMAP folder to
objects, ie partners. Matching is done via several algorithms, ie email
address, email address's domain or the original Odoo algorithm.

This gives a simple possibility to archive emails in Odoo without a mail
client integration.

Configuration
=============

In your fetchmail configuration, you'll find a new list field
``Folders to  monitor``. Add your folders here in IMAP notation (usually
something like ``INBOX.your_folder_name.your_subfolder_name``), choose a
model to attach mails to and a matching algorithm to use.

Exact mailaddress
-----------------

Fill in a field to search for the email address in ``Field (model)``.
For partners, this would be ``email``. Also fill in the header field
from the email to look at in ``Field (email)``. If you want to match
incoming mails from your customers, this would be ``from``. You can also
list header fields, so to match partners receiving this email, you might
fill in ``to,cc,bcc``.

Domain of email addresses
-------------------------

Match the domain of the email address(es) found in ``Field (email)``.
This would attach a mail to ``test1@example.com`` to a record with
``Field (model)`` set to ``test2@example.com``. Given that this is a
fuzzy match, you probably want to check ``Use 1st match``, because
otherwise nothing happens if multiple possible matches are found.

Odoo standard
-------------

This is stricly speaking no matching algorithm, but calls the model's
standard action on new incoming mail, which is usually creating a new
record.

Usage
=====

A widespread configuration is to have a shared mailbox with several
folders, i.e. one where users drop mails they want to attach to
partners. Let this folder be called ``From partners``. Then create a
folder configuration for your server with path ``"INBOX.From partners"``
(note the quotes because of the space, this is server dependent). Choose
model ``Partners``, set ``Field (model)`` to ``email`` and
``Field (email)`` to ``from``. In ``Domain``, you could fill in
``[('customer', '=', True)]`` to be sure to only match customer records.

Now when your users drop mails into this folder, they will be fetched by
Odoo and attached to the partner in question. After some testing, you
might want to check ``Delete matches`` in your folder configuration so
that this folder doesn't grow indefinitely.

Another way to prevent having to process ever more messages from the
folder to read is to automatically move all processed messages to an
archive folder that can be specified.
