=========================
Base Basic Employee Group
=========================

This module adds a new basic group in the Employee's category. This group
only has the most basic right accesses to work, the indispensable ones.
It will not have all the secondary accesses that the Employee group receives
throughout many other modules. Obviously, an user with this group alone
cannot do nothing. Ideally, this group should serve as a basis for new groups,
ones more specific and role oriented.

Installation
============

To install this module, simply follow the standard install process.
