====================
MFA Support via TOTP
====================

This module adds support for MFA using TOTP (time-based, one-time passwords). 
It allows users to enable/disable MFA and manage authentication apps/devices 
via the "Change My Preferences" view and an associated wizard. 

After logging in normally, users with MFA enabled are taken to a second screen 
where they have to enter a password generated by one of their authentication 
apps and are presented with the option to remember the current device. This 
creates a secure, HTTP-only cookie that allows subsequent logins to bypass the 
MFA step.

Installation
============

1. Install the PyOTP library using pip: ``pip install pyotp``
2. Follow the standard module install process

Configuration
=============

By default, the trusted device cookies introduced by this module have a 
``Secure`` flag. This decreases the likelihood of cookie theft via
eavesdropping but may result in cookies not being set by certain browsers
unless your Odoo instance uses HTTPS. If necessary, you can disable this flag
by going to ``Settings > Parameters > System Parameters`` and changing the
``auth_totp.secure_cookie`` key to ``0``.

Usage
=====

If necessary, a user's trusted devices can be revoked by disabling and
re-enabling MFA for that user.

Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

* Make the lifetime of the trusted device cookie configurable rather than fixed
  at 30 days
* Add device fingerprinting to the trusted device cookie
* Add company-level settings for forcing all users to enable MFA and disabling 
  the trusted device option
