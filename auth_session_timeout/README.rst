====================
Auth Session Timeout
====================

This module was written to be able to kill (logout) all inactive sessions since
a given delay. On each request the server checks if the session is yet valid
regarding the expiration delay. If not a clean logout is operated.

Configuration
=============

Two system parameters are available:

* `inactive_session_time_out_delay`: validity of a session in seconds (default
  = 2 Hours)
* `inactive_session_time_out_ignored_url`: technical urls where the check does
  not occur.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smash it by providing detailed and welcomed feedback.
