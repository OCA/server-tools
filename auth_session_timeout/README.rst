=========================
Inactive Sessions Timeout
=========================

This module was written to be able to kill(logout) all inactive sessions since
a given delay. On each request the server checks if the session is yet valid
regarding the expiration delay. If not a clean logout is operated.

Configuration
=============

Two system parameters are available:

* ``inactive_session_time_out_delay``: validity of a session in seconds
  (default = 2 Hours)
* ``inactive_session_time_out_ignored_url``: technical urls where the check
  does not occur

Usage
=====

Setup the session parameters as described above.
