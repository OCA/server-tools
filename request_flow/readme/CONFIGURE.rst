On demo mode, a set of Request Types already exists, i.e., Business trip, Borrow Items, etc.

In addition, you want to change it, or add a new request type:

#. Go to *Requests > Configuration > Request Types*.
#. Create / Update as many request types you need.
#. Use overwrite context, if you want to overwrite the default values when create new request.
