================
Repetition rules
================

This module was written to offer a field type that holds rrules according to RFC 2445.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* depend on it
* say ``from openerp.addons.field_rrule import FieldRRule``
* use ``FieldRRule`` like any other field
* on forms, use ``widget="rrule"``
* have a look at ``demo/res_partner.*``

Technically, this is a wrapper around serialized fields. The value always will be a subclass of dateutil's ``rruleset``. For technical reasons, this class overrides ``__iter__``, so if you need a proper ``rruleset``, call the value: ``my_browse_record.my_field_of_type_rrule()`` - this gives you a vanilla ``rruleset``.

If you want to pass a default, use the internal representation you'll find in the database - a list of dictionaries with the keyword arguments to be passed to rrule's constructor and a `type` field that for now can only be `rrule`: A context of ``{"default_rrule": [{"count": 1, "freq": 1, "type": "rrule", "interval": 1, "bymonthday": [1]}]}`` would give you a default for the field ``rrule`` which occurs one time at the first of the month.

In case you work with defaults and want to dumb down the UI a bit, use ``{'no_add_rule': true}``.

Further, as this is a serialized field, a value of `not set` will be represented in the database as ``'null'`` if the value was set and unset afterwards, or a database ``null`` if the value was never set - this is then also what you have to search for when you need records with your field unset.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* support the unimplemented features of rrules
* support rdates, exdates, exrules
* consider multiple widgets with different feature sets
