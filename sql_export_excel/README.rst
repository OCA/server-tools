Add the possibility to extract data from a sql query toward an excel file.
It is also possible to provide an template excel file for a query. In this case,
the data will be inserted in the specified sheet of the provided excel file. This
is usefull when doing a lot of calculation in excel and the data is coming from Odoo.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

If you want Odoo to update an existing excel file, you should create an attachment
with the excel file and configure this attachment on the query.
Then, you can configure the query to indicate if Odoo should export the header and where it should
insert the data. By default, it will insert it in the first sheet, at first row/column.
