This addon provides history for roles modifications on users.
Each time a role is added/updated/unlinked on a user, a new role history line
is created mentioning what changes were made and who made them.
These informations are directly accessible from users via a smart button.

Usage
=====

Changes on user roles are easily accessible via a button on user form view.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Since roles on role history line have 'cascade' ondelete, role deletion leads
to role history line deletion. In order to keep history even in the case of
a role deletion, module could be upgraded.
