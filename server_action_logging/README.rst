This module allows displaying logs when server actions are executed:

1. a log is generated as soon as an action starts
2. a log is generated if the action is completed without any exception
   being raised, and the log displays the duration (in seconds) of the
   action itself
3. if action's field ``Enable SQL Debug`` is set, queries are logged too
   during the action's execution

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

To enable Odoo logs tracking the actions start and duration, you just
need to install this module. To track SQL queries during an action's
execution, open the action form view and check field
``Enable SQL Debug``.
