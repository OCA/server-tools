This module allows displaying logs when server actions are executed:

1. a log is generated as soon as an action starts

2. a log is generated if the action is completed without any exception being raised, and the log displays the duration (in seconds) of the action itself

3. if action's field ``Enable SQL Debug`` is set, queries are logged too during the action's execution
