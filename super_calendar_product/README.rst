Super Calendar - Product
========================

This module was written to extend the functionality of super_calendar. It adds
a new link to a product.

The user benefits:

- a new link to a product, available on super_calendar configurator lines
- a search into super_calendar elements by their product
- a groupby on product_id in the tree view

It can also be displayed in calendar view if the user customizes its
description code during the configuration.

Installation
============

To install this module, you just need to select the module and insure yourself
dependencies are available.

Configuration
=============

No particular configuration to use this module

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to get an active super_calendar :

- choose a model with a product field (ie; sale.order.line, purchase.order.line, etc.)
- add a product field on your super_calendar configurator line
- search with a product name
- groupby on product

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This series of modules focus on common Odoo elements (partner, product,
quantity, analytic).
It would be interesting to have a unique dynamic module, but the initial
request of the customer and our budget did not allow us to do so.
