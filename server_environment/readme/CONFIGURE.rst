To configure this module, you need to edit the main configuration file
of your instance, and add a directive called ``running_env``. Commonly
used values are 'dev', 'test', 'production'::

  [options]
  running_env=dev

Values associated to keys containing 'passw' are only displayed in the 'dev'
environment.

If you don't provide any value, `test` is used as a safe default.

You have several possibilities to set configuration values:

server_environment_files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can edit the settings you need in the ``server_environment_files`` addon. The
``server_environment_files_sample`` can be used as an example:

* values common to all / most environments can be stored in the
  ``default/`` directory using the .ini file syntax;
* each environment you need to define is stored in its own directory
  and can override or extend default values;
* you can override or extend values in the main configuration
  file of your instance;

Environment variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define configuration in the environment variable ``SERVER_ENV_CONFIG``
and/or ``SERVER_ENV_CONFIG_SECRET``. The 2 variables are handled the exact same
way, this is only a convenience for the deployment where you can isolate the
secrets in a different, encrypted, file. They are multi-line environment variables
in the same configparser format than the files.
If you used options in ``server_environment_files``, the options set in the
environment variable override them.

The options in the environment variable are not dependent of ``running_env``,
the content of the variable must be set accordingly to the running environment.

Example of setup:

A public file, containing that will contain public variables::

    # These variables are not odoo standard variables,
    # they are there to represent what your file could look like
    export WORKERS='8'
    export MAX_CRON_THREADS='1'
    export LOG_LEVEL=info
    export LOG_HANDLER=":INFO"
    export DB_MAXCONN=5

    # server environment options
    export SERVER_ENV_CONFIG="
    [storage_backend.my_sftp]
    sftp_server=10.10.10.10
    sftp_login=foo
    sftp_port=22200
    directory_path=Odoo
    "

A second file which is encrypted and contains secrets::

    # This variable is not an odoo standard variable,
    # it is there to represent what your file could look like
    export DB_PASSWORD='xxxxxxxxx'
    # server environment options
    export SERVER_ENV_CONFIG_SECRET="
    [storage_backend.my_sftp]
    sftp_password=xxxxxxxxx
    "

**WARNING**

  `my_sftp` must match the name of the record.
  If you want something more reliable use `server.env.techname.mixin`
  and use `tech_name` field to reference records.
  See "USAGE".


Default values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the ``server.env.mixin`` mixin, for each env-computed field, a
companion field ``<field>_env_default`` is created. This field is not
environment-dependent. It's a fallback value used when no key is set in
configuration files / environment variable.

When the default field is used, the field is made editable on Odoo.

Note: empty environment keys always take precedence over default fields
