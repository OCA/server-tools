This module provides a way to define an environment in the main Odoo
configuration file and to read some configurations from files
depending on the configured environment: you define the environment in
the main configuration file, and the values for the various possible
environments are stored in the ``server_environment_files`` companion
module.

The ``server_environment_files`` module is optional, the values can be set using
an environment variable with a fallback on default values in the database.

The configuration read from the files are visible under the Configuration
menu.  If you are not in the 'dev' environment you will not be able to
see the values contained in the defined secret keys
(by default : '*passw*', '*key*', '*secret*' and '*token*').
