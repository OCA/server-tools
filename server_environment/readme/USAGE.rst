You can include a mixin in your model and configure the env-computed fields
by an override of ``_server_env_fields``.

::

    class StorageBackend(models.Model):
        _name = "storage.backend"
        _inherit = ["storage.backend", "server.env.mixin"]

        @property
        def _server_env_fields(self):
            return {"directory_path": {}}

Read the documentation of the class and methods in `models/server_env_mixin.py
<models/server_env_mixin.py>`__.
