================
Base Fontawesome
================

Provide up to date `Fontawesome <http://fontawesome.io/>`_ resources.

Current version: 4.7.0 (the version of this module matches it).

Installation and usage
======================

Install it as any other Odoo module. You'll get the standard Odoo Fontawesome assets
replaced with the updated version of this module.

Then in your theme styles (or any other CSS file) you can benefit from latest FA features.


Roadmap
=======

As of today Odoo v11 (master) is already shipping the latest version of FA.
In case they keep it up to date we can skip the migration of this module to v11.
Otherwise we can keep it and upgrade it to have always the most recent version.


Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues>`_. In
case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been
reported. If you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a
