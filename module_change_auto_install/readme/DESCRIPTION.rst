In odoo, by default some modules are marked as auto installable
by the ``auto_install`` key present in the manifest.

* This feature is very useful for "glue" modules that allow two modules to work together.
  (A typical example is ``sale_stock`` which allows ``sale`` and ``stock`` modules to work together).

* However, Odoo SA also marks some modules as auto installable, even though
  this is not technically required. This can happen
  for modules the company wants to promote like ``iap``,
  modules with a big wow effect like ``partner_autocomplete``,
  or some modules they consider useful by default like ``account_edi``.
  See the discussion: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/71190

This module allows to change by configuration, the list of auto installable modules,
adding or removing some modules to auto install.
