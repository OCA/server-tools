In odoo, by default some modules are marked as auto installable by the
``auto_install`` key present in the manifest.

-  This feature is very useful for "glue" modules that allow two modules
   to work together. (A typical example is ``sale_stock`` which allows
   ``sale`` and ``stock`` modules to work together).
-  However, Odoo SA also marks some modules as auto installable, even
   though this is not technically required. This can happen for modules
   the company wants to promote like ``iap``, modules with a big wow
   effect like ``partner_autocomplete``, or some modules they consider
   useful by default like ``account_edi``. See the discussion:
   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/71190

This module allows to change by configuration, the list of auto
installable modules, adding or removing some modules to auto install.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Installation
============

You don't have to install this module. To make the features working :

-  make the module ``module_change_auto_install`` available in your
   addons path
-  update your ``odoo.cfg`` following the "Configure" section

Configuration
=============

-  Edit your ``odoo.cfg`` configuration file:
-  Add the module ``module_change_auto_install`` in the
   ``server_wide_modules`` list.
-  (optional) Add a new entry ``modules_auto_install_disabled`` to mark
   a list of modules as NOT auto installable.
-  (optional) Add a new entry ``modules_auto_install_enabled`` to mark a
   list of modules as auto installable. This feature can be usefull for
   companies that are hosting a lot of Odoo instances for many
   customers, and want some modules to be always installed.

**Typical Settings**

.. code:: shell

   server_wide_modules = web,module_change_auto_install

   modules_auto_install_disabled =
       partner_autocomplete,
       iap,
       mail_bot

   modules_auto_install_enabled =
       web_responsive:web,
       base_technical_features,
       disable_odoo_online,
       account_usability

Run your instance and check logs. Modules that has been altered should
be present in your log, at the load of your instance:

.. code:: shell

   INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'iap' has been marked as NOT auto installable.
   INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'mail_bot' has been marked as NOT auto installable.
   INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'partner_autocomplete' has been marked as NOT auto installable.
   INFO db_name odoo.modules.loading: 42 modules loaded in 0.32s, 0 queries (+0 extra)

**Advanced Configuration Possibilities**

if your ``odoo.cfg`` file contains the following configuration:

.. code:: shell

   modules_auto_install_enabled =
       account_usability,
       web_responsive:web,
       base_technical_features:,
       point_of_sale:sale/purchase

The behaviour will be the following:

-  ``account_usability`` module will be installed as soon as all the
   default dependencies are installed. (here ``account``)
-  ``web_responsive`` module will be installed as soon as ``web`` is
   installed. (Althought ``web_responsive`` depends on ``web`` and
   ``mail``)
-  ``base_technical_features`` will be ALWAYS installed
-  ``point_of_sale`` module will be installed as soon as ``sale`` and
   ``purchase`` module are installed.

Development
===========

If you upgrade your odoo Instance from a major version to another, using
the OCA Free Software project "OpenUpgrade", you can also use this
module during the upgrade process, to avoid the installation of useless
new modules.
