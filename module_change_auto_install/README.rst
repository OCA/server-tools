In odoo, by default some modules are marked as auto installable
by the ``auto_install`` key present in the manifest.

* This feature is very useful for "glue" modules that allow two modules to work together.
  (A typical example is ``sale_stock`` which allows ``sale`` and ``stock`` modules to work together).

* However, Odoo SA also marks some modules as auto installable, even though
  this is not technically required. This can happen
  for modules the company wants to promote like ``iap``,
  modules with a big wow effect like ``partner_autocomplete``,
  or some modules they consider useful by default like ``account_edi``.
  See the discussion: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/71190

This module allows to change by configuration, the list of auto installable modules,
adding or removing some modules to auto install.

Installation
============

You don't have to install this module. To make the features working :

* make the module ``module_change_auto_install`` available in your addons path
* update your ``odoo.cfg`` following  the "Configure" section

Configuration
=============

* Edit your ``odoo.cfg`` configuration file:

* Add the module ``module_change_auto_install`` in the ``server_wide_modules`` list.

* (optional) Add a new entry ``modules_auto_install_disabled`` to mark
  a list of modules as NOT auto installable.

* (optional) Add a new entry ``modules_auto_install_enabled`` to mark
  a list of modules as auto installable. This feature can be usefull for companies
  that are hosting a lot of Odoo instances for many customers, and want some modules
  to be always installed.

**Typical Settings**

.. code-block:: shell

    server_wide_modules = web,module_change_auto_install

    modules_auto_install_disabled = partner_autocomplete,iap,mail_bot,account_edi,account_edi_facturx,account_edi_ubl

    modules_auto_install_enabled = web_responsive,web_no_bubble,base_technical_features,disable_odoo_online,account_menu

Run your instance and check logs. Modules that has been altered should be present in your log, at the load of your instance:

.. code-block:: shell

    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'iap' has been marked as not auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'mail_bot' has been marked as not auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'partner_autocomplete' has been marked as not auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'account_edi' has been marked as not auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'account_edi_facturx' has been marked as not auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'account_edi_ubl' has been marked as not auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.modules.loading: 42 modules loaded in 0.32s, 0 queries (+0 extra)

Development
===========

If you upgrade your odoo Instance from a major version to another,
using the OCA Free Software project "OpenUpgrade", you can also use
this module during the upgrade process, to avoid the installation of
useless new modules.
