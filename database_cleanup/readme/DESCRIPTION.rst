Clean your Odoo database from remnants of modules, models, columns and
tables left by uninstalled modules (prior to 7.0) or a homebrew database
upgrade to a new major version of Odoo.

Caution! This module is potentially harmful and can *easily* destroy the
integrity of your data. Do not use if you are not entirely comfortable
with the technical details of the Odoo data model of *all* the modules
that have ever been installed on your database, and do not purge any module,
model, column or table if you do not know exactly what you are doing.
