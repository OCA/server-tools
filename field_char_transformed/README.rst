==================================
Transform data on character fields
==================================

This module was written to give programmers a convenient way to transform text input before it is written into the database or before it is read from it.

As a practical example, FieldCharStripped is provided, which strips whitespace from the value before it is committed.

Configuration
=============

This module is a dependency to be used by programmers, not end users. There's no configuration to be done via the UI.

Usage
=====

Depend on this module and import the field classes you need::

    from openerp.addons.field_char_transformed import FieldCharTransformed, FieldCharStripped
