This module extends the functionality of any model to support multiple images
(a gallery) attached to it and allow you to manage them.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Installation
============

This module adds abstract models to work on. Its sole purpose is to serve as
base for other modules that implement galleries, so if you install this one
manually you will notice no change. You should install any other module based
on this one and this will get installed automatically.

Configuration
=============

To manage all stored images, you need to:

* Go to *Settings > Technical > Multi images*.

... but you probably prefer to manage them from the forms supplied by
submodules that inherit this behavior.

Development
===========

To develop a module based on this one:

* See module ``product_multi_image`` as an example.

* You have to inherit model ``base_multi_image.owner`` to the model that needs
  the gallery::

    class MyOwner(models.Model):
        _name = "my.model.name"
        _inherit = ["my.model.name", "base_multi_image.owner"]

        # If you need this, you will need ``pre_init_hook_for_submodules`` and
          ``uninstall_hook_for_submodules`` as detailed below.
        old_image_field = fields.Binary(related="image_main", store=False)

* Somewhere in the owner view, add::

    <field
        name="image_ids"
        nolabel="1"
        context="{
            'default_owner_model': 'my.model.name',
            'default_owner_id': id,
        }"
        mode="kanban"/>

* If the model you are extending already had an image field, and you want to
  trick Odoo to make those images to multi-image mode, you will need to make
  use of the provided `~.hooks.pre_init_hook_for_submodules` and
  `~.hooks.uninstall_hook_for_submodules`, like the
  ``product_multi_image`` module does::

    try:
        from odoo.addons.base_multi_image.hooks import (
            pre_init_hook_for_submodules,
            uninstall_hook_for_submodules,
        )
    except ImportError:
        pass


    def pre_init_hook(cr):
        """Transform single into multi images."""
        pre_init_hook_for_submodules(cr, "product.template", "image")
        pre_init_hook_for_submodules(cr, "product.product", "image_variant")


    def uninstall_hook(cr, registry):
        """Remove multi images for models that no longer use them."""
        uninstall_hook_for_submodules(cr, registry, "product.template")
        uninstall_hook_for_submodules(cr, registry, "product.product")

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* *OS file* storage mode for images is meant to provide a path where Odoo has
  read access and the image is already found, **not for making the module store
  images there**. It would be nice to add that feature though.
