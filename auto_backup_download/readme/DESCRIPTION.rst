View and download the files of backup of the databases generated by the
Database Auto-Backup module and contained in the directory on the server .

This module is meant to be a glue module between the two OCA modules:

* "Database Auto-Backup" (auto_backup)
* "Directory Files Download" (base_directory_file_download)

What this module does is to create a menu shortcut in the settings menu
(Settings -> Downloads -> Backups). The server directory displayed is the one
configured in the configuration settings of the module "Database Auto-Backup".
If multiple configurations are present for "Database Auto-Backup", then
the shortcut will only refer to the first one found.

Since the user will be able to download the backup files
directly from the Odoo interface, be aware that in case Odoo
is not working (for any reason), the user will not be able to download the backups!
