This module lets you log slow SQL statements. It is useful when you don't have
access to the PostgreSQL log or when it is difficult to correlate the
PostgreSQL log with the Odoo log.

.. warning::

    This module may leak confidential data in the log, in a similar way
    to Odoo's ``--log-level=debug_sql`` option. Use with care.

Usage
=====

Add ``slow_statement_logger`` to Odoo's ``--load`` command line option, or to the
``server_wide_modules`` configuration file entry.

Add a ``log_min_duration_statement`` entry in the ``options`` section of your
Odoo configuration file. Statements running at least this number of
milliseconds will be logged with a *debug* level in the
``odoo.addons.slow_statement_logger`` logger. ``0`` means all statements will be
logged. ``-1`` disables this logging. You can also set an environment variable
``ODOO_LOG_MIN_DURATION_STATEMENT`` which will have priority over the
configuration file entry.

Add ``odoo.addons.slow_statement_logger:DEBUG`` in your ``log_handler``
configuration file entry or ``--log-handler`` command line option.
