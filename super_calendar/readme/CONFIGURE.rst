After installing the module you can go to

*Super calendar > Configuration > Configurators*

and create a new configurator. For instance, if you want to see meetings and
phone calls, you can create the following lines

Meetings:

.. figure:: static/description/meetings.png
   :alt: meetings
   :width: 600 px

Phonecalls:

.. figure:: static/description/phone_calls.png
   :alt: phone calls
   :width: 600 px
