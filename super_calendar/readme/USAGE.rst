You click 'Generate Calendar' button or wait for the scheduled
action (‘Generate Calendar Records’) to be run.

When the calendar is generated, you can visualize it by the 'super calendar' main menu.

Here is a sample monthly calendar:

And here is the weekly one:

As you can see, several filters are available. A typical usage consists in
filtering by 'Configurator' (if you have several configurators,
'Scheduled calls and meetings' can be one of them) and by your user.
Once you filtered, you can save the filter as 'Advanced filter' or even
add it to a dashboard.
