SUPER CALENDAR
==============

This module allows to create configurable calendars.

Through the 'calendar configurator' object, you can specify which models have
to be merged in the super calendar. For each model, you have to define the
'description' and 'date_start' fields at least. Then you can define 'duration'
and the 'user_id' fields.

The 'super.calendar' object contains the merged calendars. The
'super.calendar' can be updated by 'ir.cron' or manually.

Configuration
=============

After installing the module you can go to

*Super calendar > Configuration > Configurators*

and create a new configurator. For instance, if you want to see meetings and
phone calls, you can create the following lines

Meetings:

.. image:: /super_calendar/static/description/meetings.png
   :width: 400 px

Phonecalls:

.. image:: /super_calendar/static/description/phone_calls.png
   :width: 400 px

Then, you can use the 'Generate Calendar' button or wait for the scheduled
action (‘Generate Calendar Records’) to be run.

When the calendar is generated, you can visualize it by the 'super calendar' main menu.

Here is a sample monthly calendar:

And here is the weekly one:

.. image:: /super_calendar/static/description/week_calendar.png
   :width: 400 px

As you can see, several filters are available. A typical usage consists in
filtering by 'Configurator' (if you have several configurators,
'Scheduled calls and meetings' can be one of them) and by your user.
Once you filtered, you can save the filter as 'Advanced filter' or even
add it to a dashboard.
