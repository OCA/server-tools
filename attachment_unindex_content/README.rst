This module disables the indexation of attachments content.

Attachment model has a field called 'index_content' where the content of the
attachment is read and stored directly in the database. This field is useful in
order to search content of a file. But most of cases it is not used, so, you
can install this module in order to:

- **Avoid Duplicating Data:** Because indexation extracts text content from
  files and put it on the database in order it could be searched, but this
  implies you have the file data in your ``filestore`` directory, and also part
  (or sometimes all) of that data in your database too.
- **Improve Performance:** Since not all indexed files are plain text,
  they require extra process to read them.

Maybe you could try to uninstall modules like ``document`` in order to disable
its indexation features, but you could face the uninstallation of other modules
that could be useful for you (e.g, ``hr_recruitment`` depends on that).

But even if you don't have ``document`` installed, you'd still have plain text
content indexation by default. As you can see in this SQL query results,
indexation is active even without it:

Using this module you will not require to uninstall any module to disable
the attachment content indexation, because we directly disable it at
``ir.attachment`` base.

Also, after the installation, the ``index_content`` field on attachments
already recorded in database will be cleared.
