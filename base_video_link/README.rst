Usage
=====

Inherit your record with the mixin "video.link.mixin" and you have the possibility to add video on your record

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- we should be able to sort video locally (the sort is global), for this it will be great to have a generic module that implement "m2m_sortable" and store the sequence in the relation table
